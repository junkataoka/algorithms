"""
Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be exactly one valid solution.

Your solution must use 
O
(
1
)
O(1) additional space.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4], target = 3

Output: [1,2]
Explanation:
The sum of 1 and 2 is 3. Since we are assuming a 1-indexed array, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 1000
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
-1000 <= target <= 1000

        total = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
        if total == target:
            return [l+1, r+1]

        elif total < target:
            l += 1

            r -= 1
