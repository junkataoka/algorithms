"""
You are given a 2-D matrix board containing 'X' and 'O' characters.

If a continous, four-directionally connected group of 'O's is surrounded by 'X's, it is considered to be surrounded.

Change all surrounded regions of 'O's to 'X's and do so in-place by modifying the input board.

Example 1:



Input: board = [
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","O","O","X"],
  ["X","O","O","X"],
  ["X","X","X","O"]
]

Output: [
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","X"],
  ["X","X","X","O"]
]
Explanation: Note that regions that are on the border are not considered surrounded regions.

Constraints:

1 <= board.length, board[i].length <= 200
board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
